- I mainly just ran the game and did a number of tests to make sure everything worked no matter the state. These tests included:
	- losing and gaining the balls and miniBalls through shooting them and getting the powerUps
	- setting the starting number of miniBalls and Balls to the max number of them you can have on the screen and checking to make sure 
	no more miniBalls or balls get added to the display until the totals go down
	- I also tested the snapshot and archiving to make sure it works properly and everything checks out
